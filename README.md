Hello, I am a software engineer with over 5 years of experience in JavaScript, React, PHP, Laravel, and Flutter. Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in developing and delivering high-quality, scalable web applications that provide a seamless user experience.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a firm believer in the potential of web 3 technologies to revolutionize the way we interact with the digital world. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in this field and exploring new and innovative ways to apply these technologies in my work.

Aside from my love for technology. I have a keen interest in starting my own venture and building solutions that make a meaningful impact on people's lives. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my skills, knowledge, and network in this area.

I am a results-driven individual who is passionate about delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of my clients and users. I enjoy working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, and I am always up for a challenge.

If you are looking for a highly motivated and experienced software engineer with a passion for web 3 technologies and entrepreneurship, I would be happy to discuss how I can bring value to your organization.
<br />

I'm currently based in **[Tanger, Morocco.]
 
<br />
I love learning new techs and using new tools. I also love drinking Atay (Tea in Ar - Morocco) while coding.
